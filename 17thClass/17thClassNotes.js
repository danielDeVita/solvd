RegExp = 

RegExp is a class but also a literal

literal:
const re = /abc/; (slash to start and end regex)

constructor class:
const re1 = new RegExp("abc")

They both show the same pattern

METODS:

/abc/.test("abcde") => true
/abc/.test("abdef") => false

"abc".indexOf("abc") => ???

SYNTAX:

/[0123456789]/ => means any digit symbol

/[0-9]/ (same as above)

\d = meas any digit
\w = means alphabetical symbol like [a-z A-Z]
\s = means space symbol (also tabulation, enter, and so on)
\D = means NOT digit
\W = means NOT alphabetical
\S = means NOT space
.- = any symbol but

[\d.] = ???

/[^01]/ = any symbol BUT 0 and 1
/[^01]/.test("10110") => false (checks binary)
/[^01]/.test("10211") => true (checks binary)

COUNTERS:

+ (means symbol can be repeated from [1,infinity])
\d+ = accept one or more digits (not 0)

* (means from [0, infinity])
\d* = accept from 0 digits forward

? (means from [0,1])... it will only be 1 symbol, not 2 o 0

{4} (means exact numner [4,4])
accepts a range like {2,4}
{ ,5} => means from 0 to 5
{5, } => means from 5 to infinity

GROUP OF EXPRESSIONS:

/abc/g (means looking not only for first substring, but all substring)

/abc/gi (means it is not case sensitive)

/boo+(hoo+)+/i => means you have a group starting with 'h" and as many
"o" as needed, preceded by "boo" or "Boo"
ie: Boo hoo hoooo hooooo
