/* 

- Iterative development model:

We put every functionality and then deploy it, working incrementally.
Old versions have all the functionality, not just a part.
Use when:
    we know all requirements
    when it is a big project
    when we have a main taks but small details can be provided later


- Spiral Model:

Start with one feature, add more features as they come up.
Work on them in order of priority.
Use when:
    we don't know all requirements
    when there are many tasks to do at once
    when we need to get something done quickly (like fixing bugs)


- Agile model:
Add new functionalities as soon as possible.
Iterate until everything works well.
Use when:
    we don't know all requirements
    there are many tasks to do at once
    we want to deliver value fast

Kanban:
- No specific time frame for each task
- Prioritize based on business goals
- Tasks should be completed by the end of the day
- Useful for managing multiple projects simultaneously
Scrum:
- Short iterations (2 weeks or less)
- Clearly defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
- Daily standups
- Sprint planning meeting
